Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Product Manager position at InnovateX. Your focus on building impactful SaaS platforms aligns with my track record of delivering customer-centric solutions.

At CloudWorks, I led the development of an analytics dashboard that increased daily active users by 25% and reduced churn by 15% through data-driven feature prioritization. My experience in Agile environments and strong analytical skills have consistently enabled me to bridge customer needs with technical solutions.

I am eager to contribute to InnovateX's mission of creating industry-leading products. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Priya Verma
