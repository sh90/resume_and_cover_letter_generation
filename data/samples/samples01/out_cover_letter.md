Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Data Scientist – Marketing Analytics role at Acme Corp. Your mission to optimize marketing performance aligns with my background in data-driven decision-making.

My strong command of Python, SQL, and Tableau equips me to build predictive models and communicate actionable insights to diverse stakeholders.

I look forward to bringing my analytical expertise to Acme Corp’s marketing team and contributing to your growth. Thank you for considering my application.
