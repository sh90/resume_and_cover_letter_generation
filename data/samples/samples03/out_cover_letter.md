Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer â€“ Backend role at CodeCraft. Your commitment to building efficient, scalable systems resonates with my expertise.

At DevCore, I developed RESTful APIs that handled over 50k daily requests and optimized database performance by reducing query times by 40%. My proficiency in Python, Django, and PostgreSQL ensures that I can contribute effectively to backend feature development and integration.

I am eager to bring my problem-solving skills and passion for clean code to CodeCraft's engineering team. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Smith
